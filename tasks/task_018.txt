# Title: Implement Local Storage for Session Persistence
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Add local storage to persist the application state within a browser session.
# Details:
Implement functionality to save the application state to localStorage whenever it changes, and load it when the application starts. This provides a basic form of session persistence without requiring explicit save/load actions from the user.

# Test Strategy:
Test closing and reopening the browser to ensure the application state is correctly persisted and restored.
