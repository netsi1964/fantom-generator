# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Multilingual UI Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add support for multiple languages in the UI based on the lang.json file.
# Details:
Create a module that loads language data from a lang.json file (following the structure in PRD-SEC-015). Implement a function that updates all UI elements with data-translate attributes based on the selected language. Connect this to the language selector dropdown. Default to English if a translation is missing.

# Test Strategy:
Test switching between languages to ensure all UI elements update correctly. Test with missing translations to ensure fallback to English works.
