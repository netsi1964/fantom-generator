# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Case Information Form Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect the case information form fields to the application state.
# Details:
Add event listeners to the case information form fields (Title, Case/Journal Number, Date) to update the application state when they change. Ensure these values are included in the JSON export and prompt generation.

# Test Strategy:
Test entering various values in the case information fields and verify they are correctly included in the prompt and JSON export.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create state management for case information fields [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define state variables and update functions for case information fields in the application state
### Details:
1. Identify the application state management approach (e.g., React Context, Redux, or simple state)
2. Add new state variables for case information fields: title, caseNumber, and date
3. Create appropriate setter functions or actions to update these state values
4. Ensure the state has appropriate default values
5. Update the state interface/type definitions if using TypeScript
6. Test the state management by manually triggering state updates and verifying the state changes correctly

## 2. Connect form fields to state with event listeners [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Add event handlers to form fields to update application state when values change
### Details:
1. Locate the case information form component in the codebase
2. Add onChange/onInput event listeners to each form field (Title, Case/Journal Number, Date)
3. Connect these event listeners to the state update functions created in subtask 1
4. Ensure proper value binding so form fields reflect current state values
5. Add appropriate validation if needed (e.g., date format validation)
6. Test the form by entering values and verifying the application state updates correctly
7. Verify that changes persist when navigating between different parts of the application

## 3. Include case information in JSON export and prompt generation [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Update export and prompt generation functionality to include case information fields
### Details:
1. Locate the JSON export functionality in the codebase
2. Modify the export function to include the case information fields (title, caseNumber, date) in the exported JSON structure
3. Find the prompt generation functionality
4. Update the prompt template to include the case information fields where appropriate
5. Test the JSON export by filling the form and verifying the exported JSON contains the case information
6. Test the prompt generation by verifying case information appears correctly in the generated prompt
7. Ensure backward compatibility with existing data that might not have these fields
