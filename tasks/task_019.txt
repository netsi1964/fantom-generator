# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement GenAI Image Generation Feature
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Connect the GenAI image generation feature to the prompt generation.
# Details:
Implement the click handler for the 'Generate Image' button. When clicked, it should take the current prompt and the API key entered by the user, make a request to a GenAI API (placeholder for future implementation), and display the result in the image-result container. For MVP, this can be a mock implementation that displays a placeholder image or message.

# Test Strategy:
Test clicking the 'Generate Image' button with various prompts to ensure the mock implementation works correctly.
